'VBA Script Homework Moderate And Hard Challange
'Moderate
'Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.
'The ticker symbol.
'Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
'The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
'The total stock volume of the stock.
'Hard
'Your solution will include everything from the moderate challenge.
'Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
'Solution will look as follows
